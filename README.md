## About 

This is a web app that scrapes https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/17562/dinner/. Users have to click the "Scrape" button first to get results for recipes. Users are given the option to save their favorite dish or view the recipe directly from the original site. Once the user saves a dish, they can click on the "Saved Recipes" button and view their favorites. The option for the link still remains, with the additional function of unsaving a recipe or adding notes. After adding notes, the user is given the option to delete the note.
